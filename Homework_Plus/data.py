row_for_hm_9 = "There are different kinds of animals on our planet, and all of them are very important for it. \
For example, everybody knows that the sharks are dangerous for people, but they are useful for cleaning seawater. \
There are two types of animals: domestic (or pets) and wild. People keep pets in their homes. And some wild animals \
are very dangerous. Domestic animals live next to people, whereas wild animals’ “homes” are forests, jungles, oceans \
and so on. Giraffes are very beautiful and unusual animals. They are the tallest land animals in the world. Giraffes \
can reach a height of 5,5 m and a weight of 900 kg. They are famous for their long necks. But does anybody know that \
giraffes have a very long tongue? They can even clean the ears with it! Giraffes are usually yellow or light brown \
with dark stains. Giraffes live in African savannas. They can live from 20 до 30 years. It is interesting to know \
that giraffes sleep only for a few minutes at a time. They sit down on the ground and bend their long neck down. \
Giraffes do not hunt. They eat leaves, grass, and fruit. Due to their long neck, they can reach the highest leaves on \
the trees that other animals cannot eat. You can often meet giraffes in city Zoos. They are very friendly and all the \
children like them very much."
